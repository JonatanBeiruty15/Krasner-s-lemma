# MyLeanProject

This repository contains formalization work and visualization materials from a Lean seminar project. The core goal of the project is to provide a formal proof of **Krasner's Lemma** using the Lean theorem prover, along with an animated explanation built with **Manim**.

## âœ¨ Project Highlights

- ðŸ“š Formal proof of **Krasner's Lemma** in Lean
- ðŸ§  Focus on p-adic numbers and field extensions
- ðŸŽ¥ Accompanying **Manim animation** for visual intuition
- ðŸŽ“ Developed as part of a Lean seminar focused on formal verification and constructive mathematics

## ðŸ”§ Structure

- `src/` â€“ Lean code, definitions, and proofs
- `manim/` â€“ Manim animation code (Python) visualizing the key ideas
- `README.md` â€“ You're reading it ðŸ™‚
- `lakefile.lean` â€“ Lean build configuration (if using Lake)

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

- [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io)
- [Manim](https://docs.manim.community) (Python)

## ðŸ§ª How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyLeanProject.git
